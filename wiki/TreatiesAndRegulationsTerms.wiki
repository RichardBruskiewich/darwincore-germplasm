Plant genetic resources are essential to a sustainable agriculture and food security. Some fear that corporate financial interests might prevent safeguarding of livelihoods, promotion of food security, biodiversity-rich farming under control of local communities, and implementation of Farmers' Rights. A number of treaties and regulations are developed to control and ensure access to plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (under the multi-lateral system of benefit sharing).
