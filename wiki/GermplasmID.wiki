DwC-Germplasm GermplasmID

http://rs.nordgen.org/dwc/germplasm/0.1/terms/GermplasmID

Redundant term as this is semantically the same term as dwc:occurrenceID [[http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/index.htm#occurrenceID URL]]

The recommendation is to use dwc:occurrenceID and NOT the GermplasmID term.

The previous term dwc:sampleID was removed from the DarwinCore and semantically included in the dwc:occurrenceID term for the final new revised Darwin Core.
