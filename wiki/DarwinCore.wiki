= Darwin Core =

Darwin Core (DwC) is designed around a set of general (core) terms applicable for most biodiversity datasets. Darwin Core also implements extensions to the core terms, designed to include terms of more specific utility in thematic domains such as the community for plant genetic resources. The Darwin Core Germplasm Extension has been developed to include the additional terms required to describe germplasm samples maintained by genebanks worldwide.

The Darwin Core is based on the standards developed by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative  and should be viewed as an extension of the Dublic Core for biodiversity information. The purpose of these terms is to facilitate data sharing by providing a well-defined standard core vocabulary in a flexible framework to minimize the barriers to adoption and to maximize re-usability. The Darwin Core can be extended by adding new terms to share additional information.
